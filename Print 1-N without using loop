JAVA solution
In this solution, we will use the concept of recursion for the printing of numbers which helps us to print numbers without using loops.



class Solution
{
    
  public void printNos(int N)
    {
        if(N==0)
        {
            return;
        }
        printNos(N-1);
        System.out.print(N+" ");
    }
}
